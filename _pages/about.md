Welcome to my website! 

I am an enthusiastic development economist and a third year Ph.D. student at [the Department of Economics](https://economics.ucsc.edu/), [University of California, Santa Cruz(UCSC)](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I work in Development Economics and Applied Econometrics, with ongoing field experiments in Rwanda and Kenya.
