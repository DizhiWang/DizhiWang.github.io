Welcome to my website! 

I am an enthusiastic development economist and an Economics Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://economics.ucsc.edu/), [University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)](https://www.ucsc.edu/), advised by Professor [Jonathan Robinson](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jmrtwo/). My research focuses on the economic development of lower income countries and how technology can help with the global poverty reduction. I have conducted fieldwork in Rwanda, Kenya, and Tanzania. I'm currently a visiting scientist at [International Livestock Research Institute(ILRI)](https://www.ilri.org/) in Nairobi, Kenya.
