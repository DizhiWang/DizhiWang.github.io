Welcome to my website! 

I am an enthusiastic development economist and an Economics Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://economics.ucsc.edu/), [University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)](https://www.ucsc.edu/), advised by Professor [Jonathan Robinson](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jmrtwo/). My research focuses on the economic development of lower income countries and how technology can help with the global poverty reduction. I have lived in Rwanda, Tanzania, and Kenya for field research. My ongoing field projects are mainly in Rwanda and Kenya.
