	We measure the benefit to society created by preventing COVID-19 deaths through a marginal increase in early social distancing. We exploit county-level rainfall on the last weekend before statewide lockdown in the early phase of the pandemic. After controlling for historical rainfall, temperature, and state fixed-effects, current rainfall is a plausibly exogenous instrument for social distancing. A one percent decrease in the population leaving home on the weekend before lockdown creates an average of 132 dollars of benefit per county resident within 2 weeks. The impacts of earlier distancing compound over time and mainly arise from lowering the risk of a major outbreak, yielding large but unevenly distributed social benefit.

  Lack of access to output markets is a key barrier to productivity growth of agriculture in developing countries, because it reduces the profitability of investment in productivity. We conduct a field experiment with 180 maize-growing cooperatives in rural Rwanda where a treatment group received support from the WFP Farm to Market Alliance to form connections with processors, while a control group farmed as usual. We find that the program immediately increased the probability of selling into the formal output value chain, and dramatically increased revenue by 150%-300%, driven largely by large increases in land under cultivation and input usage.

	Many farmers in rural areas of developing countries do not use high quality inputs, either because sellers of quality inputs are located far away or because the quality of inputs cannot be ascertained easily. This not only keeps farmers' income low in the short run, but also has deleterious long-term consequences by preventing the development of value chains which requires reliable access to high quality farm output. In this study, we propose a pilot to establish a market for high-quality cassava planting materials among cooperatives in Rwanda. Working with IITA and RAB, we will randomly provide certification to cassava cooperatives, and supplement this with a demand stimulation intervention in which we will provide a subset of local farmers with information on crop diseases and how they can procure quality cassava planting material from certified cooperatives. We will measure impacts on crop diseases, profits and yields of cooperatives, as well as cassava planting and sourcing decisions of local farmers.
