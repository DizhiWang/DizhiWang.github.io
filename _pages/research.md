<h2> Working Paper </h2>

- [“Globalization with Capital Integration and Spatial Deindustrialization”]\\
**Abstract**\\
This paper incorporates a mobile capital market into the canonical model of firm heterogeneity and trade, introducing a global capital market condition that links wages and firm entry—an element absent from the standard framework. This new mechanism is closely tied to the intensity of the mobile factor in production and generates novel policy implications. When the mobile factor's intensity is low, unilateral trade liberalization reduces wages and lowers prices, aligning with standard predictions. However, when the mobile factor is highly intensive, delocation effects intensify, leading to higher prices—a result reminiscent of the Metzler paradox. These findings offer fresh insights into trade policy and the dynamics of deindustrialization across industries.\\
