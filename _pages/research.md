### **Globalization with Capital Integration and Spatial Deindustrialization**  [working paper](/files/Rev_Melitz_extended_with_mobile_capital.pdf).


**Abstract**  
This paper extends the canonical model of firm heterogeneity and trade by incorporating a mobile capital market and a global capital market condition that endogenously links wages and firm entry—an element absent in standard frameworks. The impact of this mechanism depends critically on the intensity of the mobile factor in production. When capital intensity is low, unilateral trade liberalization reduces both wages and prices, but the price-reducing effect is dampened due to firm delocation.  As capital intensity increases, prices fall by less due to delocation effects from capital flight.  At very high capital intensities, delocation effects dominate and unilateral liberalization leads to higher prices, producing outcomes reminiscent of the Metzler paradox.  Calibrating the model to US statistics (0.33 capital share, 0.11 export share of GDP) workers experience welfare losses under unilateral tariff reductions, as wage declines outweigh price decreases.  Overall, we find that countries may optimally raise unilateral trade barriers to prevent capital flight. These findings offer new insights into trade policy and the structural dynamics of deindustrialization.
