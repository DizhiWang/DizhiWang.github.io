        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>
            I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the 
            <a href="https://economics.ucsc.edu/">University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)</a>, 
            advised by Professor 
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acspearot/home">Alan Spearot</a> 
            with research interests in international trade and macroeconomics. My work examines 
            how capital mobility shapes globalizationâ€™s effects, particularly how firms, wages, 
            and welfare respond to trade liberalization.
