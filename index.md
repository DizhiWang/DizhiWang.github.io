Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC)](https://economics.ucsc.edu/), advised by Professor [Alan Spearot](https://sites.google.com/view/acspearot/home) with research interests in international trade and macroeconomics. My work examines how capital mobility shapes globalizationâ€™s effects, particularly how firms, wages, and welfare respond to trade liberalization.
